Built viral word guessing game Wordle using HTML, CSS, and Java Script. 
This project is based off the New York Times game in which the user gets 6 attempts to guess a random 5 letter word.

The user will be prompted with three different colors based on which letters the word contains.
Gray means that the letter doesn't appear anywhere in the word.
Yellow means that the letter appears in the word, but not in the position that the user entered it.
Green means that the letter appears in the word at the exact position that the user entered.
